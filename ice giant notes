SLIDE 1
- These plots show cooling curves using our model using an interior with no condensation....roughly in the same ballpark as previous work shown in Fortney 2011 and Scheibe 2019

SLIDE 2
- Briefly mention our moist adiabat model in contrast with dry adiabat
	-This reverts to a dry adiabat when there is no condensation

SLIDE 3
- These plots were generated using a moist adiabatic model that does not yet handle the formation of a radiative zone ( z1 is the initial homogeneous abundance for the outer envelope) 

- Shows that the outer envelope will be stabilized against convection with supercritical z1

- The bottom of the radiative layer (cloud base) would be the top of each shaded region, which will be shown in next slide

SLIDE 4
- In these plots, the model now handles the creation of a radiative zone where convection is inhibited by condensation

- Re: q_deep = 0.05, note the slight kinks in the PT graphs show the base of the condensation zone…but these not stable against convection because of subcritical z1 abundance

- Visible are the radiative gradient temperature jumps for the plots where q_deep = 0.15 and 0.25 where we have a critical abundance

- The onset of condensation-inhibited convection occurs just after t10 = 380K for both q_deep = 0.15 and 0.25

SLIDE 5
- Similar to previous plot but highlighting the difference between q_deep 0.05 and 0.25, of note:

- Especially clear for current/recent t-10’s, this plot highlights that the deep interior looks like a hotter deep interior from earlier t-10’s, relative to the subcritical model

SLIDE 6
- Light blue and dashed red horizontal lines are observed T_eff for Neptune and Uranus, respectively. Vertical line is ~4.6 Gyr

- Do we want all z1’s here, or just z=0.25 since abundance doesn’t seem to have a huge impact?
