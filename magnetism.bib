Decreasing magnetism as nanoparticle size increases which they blame on volume dependence and surface effect.  Pressure
reduces and kills magnetism.  No Co-O-Co bond angle measurements, unfortunately.  When volume effect kills magnetism, is the volume comparable to bulk LCO?  Check our own data...  See our figure for angle for different particles.  Our angles for LCO bulk are
somewhat smaller, nano are comparable.  The temperature changes are comparable to the changes with size reported here.  This does not explain the dfference between bulk and nano, I think.

Important paper even for LCO.  Magnetic phase separation, but only for 0.4<x<0.22.  How do we reconcile this with

transition between them, as experiments suggest.

Mostly theoretical paper LDA + U that shows the LS/HS mixed state is the probable excited state in films.

LSCO phase separation about 10nm.  Supposedly exchange bias between regions.  Magnetization in very

Na doping for x=0.75.  Reduces the Co-O-Co bond angle and increases Co-O length, with expected magnetic changes, i.e. consistent with what we get by making nanoparticles.  Really supports these parameters as important for determining magnetism.  Also seems to round the transition at 10 percent.

Rather complicated discussion, but it seems to say that neither IS nor HS states quite work to describe all the experimental results and implies p-d hybridization must be taken into account.  I already believe that and the real picture must be done through adequate band theory and extended states.  Harmon find, for example, the eg state is spread all over in energy - it is not just a high energy state.

resistivity increases rapidly. (I thought the state below 100K was insulating - not so much in this range at least.)

Particle sizes, not domain sizes, 60-450nm.  They suggest that the particle properties must
be intrinsic to the system.  They suggest paramagnetism from higher spin states coexists
with ferromagnetism, but I do not understand their argument.  They suggest a surface
effect since it goes like D^-1, but that could also be our domain wall argument.  They want
ferromagnetism to be between Co3+ - this does not explain why Tc does not vary.  Suggest
phase separation between LS and HS.  Measurements at 500G.
