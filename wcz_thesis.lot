This would be the normal size that you would make a table, so that it is most readable, unless it's hard to fit everything in. Some journals (like Physical Review) use captions at the bottom of tables that can be as wordy as the caption to a figure, like this one. If your thesis is in physics or applied physics, rather than astrophysics, you should use this convention.}}{3}%
