\chapter{Introduction}
Observations of Uranus show a planet that appears to be in thermal equilibrium with the Sun. Observation has also shown that Uranus is cooler than its more distant neighbor, Neptune. Meanwhile, thermal evolution models for Uranus have not matched observation, instead predicting a warmer effective temperature during the current epoch\citep{fortney_2011}, \citep{podolak_1991}, \citep{hubbard_1995}, \citep{scheibe_2019} [There are other papers by Nettelmann 2013, Linder 2019 that I haven't looked at yet]. 

There have been various attempts to model the underluminous Uranus. [how much should i go into work done with different EOS's?] The formation of stable layers, trapping internal energy in the the interior of Uranus and Neptune was proposed by \citep{podolak_1991}. Work on the formation of stable condensation zones, inhibiting convection, have been investigated by \citep{friedson_2017}, \citep{leconte_2017}, and \citep{guillot_1995}.
