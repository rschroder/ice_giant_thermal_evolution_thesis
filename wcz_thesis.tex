\chapter{Introduction}
Since the work of Rupert Wildt\citep{wildt_1947}, astronomers have been modeling hydrogen dominated planets. The influential paper of the mid-twentieth century was written by Wendell DeMarcus\citep{demarcus_1958}. In this paper, DeMarcus gave a lengthy description.... Attempts at modeling the interior structure and atmosphere of the solar system giant planets significantly accelerated in the later half of the twentieth century shortly after Frank Low, confirmed by way of observation, that Jupiter was radiating more heat than it received from the Sun \citep{low_1966}. By the 1970's, modeling efforts by \citep{graboske_1975}, \citep{hubbard_1977}, and \citep{pollack_1977} for Jupiter and Saturn began incorporating model atmospheres with models of interiror structure to better investigate the thermal evolution of these giant planets. 


In section 1.1, we review prior work done on model Uranus and Neptune. In section 1.2, we review prior work done on the formation of water condensation zones in these hydrogen rich atmospheres. In chapter 2, we describe our model and present our results. In chapter 3, we discuss the ramifications of condensation inhibited convection for the thermal evolution of Uranus. Finally, in chapter 4, we summarize our findings.\citep{friedson_2017} \citep{leconte_2017} \citep{pollack_1977}\citep{fortney_2011} \citep{graboske_1975} \citep{guillot_2019} \citep{guillot_1995}

\section{Model Uranus and Neptune with Dry Convection}\label{model_atmosphere_background}

Will review current understanding of solar system giant planet thermal evolution here, referencing work done by Fortney, et al., and others. Not sure how far back I want to go here, but will probably mention when, and by who, thermal evolution modeling began, and then quickly get into the thermal evolution background from fortney papers.

\section{Condensation-inhibited Convection}\label{condensation_background}

This section will contain theory and results surrounding condensation in hydrogen rich atmospheres, citing LeConte, Friedson, others.
